# mac_desktop_cleanup_script

When it comes to keeping my computer in order, I am a bit of a pig. Occasionally, my desktop has so many icons on it that they start to copy over the top of each other. This shell script archives the desktop by creating a dated directory and then moves things from the desktop into automatically created directories: csv, xls, word, pdf, powerpoint, txt, word, other.
